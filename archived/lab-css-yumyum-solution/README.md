## Instructions

### Iteration 1: Setup

#### Fonts

Body's type is [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato). You should include the font with Google Fonts with the following weights: `normal`, `bold`, `black`.

Headings type is a custom font called Intro. It is already included into the page and available through: `font-family:"Intro";` with 2 `font-weight`s : `400` and `900`.

#### Images

For gray images, use placeholders (you can use any from [https://placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com)).

All other images are provided into the `images` folder. Insert as many `<img>` tags as you need into the HTML. Or you could also use CSS property `background` to set the images in your page.

It's up to you.
